## Task 1

#### This task presents a detailed study on the application of logistic regression for binary classification of the Iris dataset into Setosa and Not Setosa species. Emphasizing the model's performance, it achieves 100% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, indicating a perfect classifier with no misclassifications. This success is attributed to effective data preprocessing, including feature scaling and categorical variable encoding, and the utilization of petal measurements for species classification. Furthermore, the implementation validates the logistic regression model's efficacy in leveraging petal and sepal dimensions for distinguishing between Setosa and Not Setosa species, underlined by a balanced dataset and comprehensive evaluation metrics.
